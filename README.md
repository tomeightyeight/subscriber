Email Subscribers Technical Task

First Angular app i've built (usually work with Backbone so a bit of a learning experiance). 

If possible i'd like the opportunity to submit another app written in Backbone.js! I think I bit off a bit more than I can chew attempting this in a couple of hours with a framework i've not touched yet.

There is a node.js server backend that listens on port 3000 (package.json included).
