Email Subscribers Technical Task

First Angular app i've built (usually work with Backbone so a bit of a learning experiance). 

There is a node.js server backend that listens on port 3000 (package.json included).

This app currently consists of multiple views and is parsing the CSV file succesfully. Problems linking the views with the uploadController for some reason.

If possible i'd like the opportunity to submit another app written in Backbone.js! I think I bit off a bit more than I can chew attempting this in a couple of hours with a framework i've not touched yet.
