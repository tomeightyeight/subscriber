Mailing List CSV Parser

First Angular app i've built (usually work with Backbone so a bit of a learning experiance). 

There is a node.js back end that listens on port 3000 (package.json included).

This app currently consists of multiple views and is parsing the CSV file succesfully. Problems linking the views with the uploadController for some reason.
